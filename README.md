# DCGAN - Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network
  In recnet years, there have veen tremendous advancements in the field of machine learning. Lately a amount of research has been dedicated to the usage of generative models in the field of computer vision and iamge classification. The original model proposed by Goodfellow, which is composed of a adversarial nets and discriminative network. However, there are also existing some limitation of original GAN, such as 
  
  DCGAN, which is also called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks, is one of the successful network design for GAN.
